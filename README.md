This Privacy Policy outlines the policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in relation to the Since Reminder and Day Counter App ("the App"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and ensuring the security of their personal information.

Information Collection and Use:
The App does not collect any personal information from its users. It operates solely on the user's mobile device and does not require an internet connection. All data and information entered into the App, including reminders, events, and day counts, are stored locally on the user's device.

Information Security:
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information stored within the App. This includes encryption and other security safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of user data.

Information Sharing:
As the App does not collect any personal information, we do not share or disclose user data with third parties.

Parental Consent and Age Verification:
If your app is intended for use by children or if it may attract children as users, you should obtain parental consent and verify the age of users. It is the responsibility of parents or legal guardians to provide consent for their child's use of the App. We recommend that parents monitor their children's use of the App and assist them in understanding the importance of privacy and responsible online behavior.

Data Collection and Usage:
We do not collect any personal information from users. However, if any personal information is voluntarily provided by users within the App's functionalities (such as adding personal notes or descriptions), users acknowledge and agree to be responsible for such disclosures.

Data Retention and Deletion:
User data entered into the App is stored locally on the user's device. Users have full control over their data and can delete or modify it at any time. We do not retain user data beyond the period of usage by the user.

Advertising:
The App does not display any third-party advertisements. Therefore, no personal information is shared with advertisers or ad networks.

Children's Privacy:
The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete such information from our records.

Changes to the Privacy Policy:
We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy within the App. It is the user's responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
